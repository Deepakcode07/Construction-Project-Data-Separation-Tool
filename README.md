# Construction-Project-Data-Separation-Tool
This repository contains a Python script to efficiently split a large CSV file containing construction project data into multiple CSV files based on specified columns. The script ensures that each output file contains only the relevant data for projects, customers, builders, materials, and properties, making it highly useful for data engineers, analysts, and developers managing construction data pipelines.

Key Features:
Column-Based File Splitting: Automatically checks for the existence of columns and separates data into project, customer, builder, material, and property CSV files.
Error Handling for Missing Columns: Notifies the user if any required columns are missing from the input data, ensuring accurate output.
Optimized for Large Datasets: Handles large construction data efficiently, splitting them into smaller, manageable files for better organization.
Customizable Output Paths: You can define the output file paths for each separated file according to your projectâ€™s structure.

Usage Example:
The script reads the input CSV containing construction project data and separates it into five distinct CSV files:

project_data.csv: Contains information about each construction project.
customer_data.csv: Contains customer-related data.
builder_data.csv: Stores information about builders and their ratings.
material_data.csv: Includes material-related data such as price and quantity.
property_data.csv: Contains details of the properties in the project.
Why Use This Script?
Automated Data Organization: Automatically splits large CSV files into smaller, more manageable ones for easy data handling.
Data Validation: The script checks for missing columns and informs the user, ensuring complete and accurate output.
Improved Workflow: Simplifies the process of organizing and managing large construction datasets, making it perfect for data pipelines.
